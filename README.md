# EV3-reinforcement-learning-robot
EV3 robot following a path using reinforcement learning.
robot behaviours changing respect to the battery amount left.
robotcontrolbat is the main file.

this project done using subsumption architecure and behaviours stack from less complex to the more complex bottom up. 
shutdown drive hitwall are the basic behaviours.

once the robot learn enough we can call the function "Q_learned_run" and load the saved Q data and run the robot without learning to get the expected behaviour.
